# Startup Incorporation Checklist
#### How to bootstrap a Delaware C-corp (or S-corp) with employee(s) in California

**Disclaimer:** I am not a lawyer (IANAL). This list is intended as a learning tool and you should *definitely* consult with a lawyer if you have any questions or concerns. This is a work in progress, so suggestions and pull requests are welcome!

##### Intro
Other than building a product people want, incorporating a new business is essential to raising money, opening a bank account, and creating a legal entity for contracts and other liabilities. For technical folks like me, it's the "necessary evil" of founding a company and just needs to get done. Having gone through this recently, I made a checklist in case I'd have to do it again in the near future. Why you should incorporate in DE is outside the scope of this article, but [other folks have written good answers](https://www.quora.com/Why-do-most-technology-startups-incorporate-in-Delaware).

Some notes:
- The full process will take several weeks to complete
- Most steps are sequential and depend on an earlier step being complete
- Many steps require the use of snail mail or a [fax machine](#tools)
- For brevity, Delaware and California are shortened to *DE* and *CA*
- Again, consult your lawyer. Some will defer fees for startups

# The checklist
#### Register with DE
- [ ] Choose a name for your business and check that it's available. [DE Name Search](https://icis.corp.delaware.gov/Ecorp/EntitySearch/NameSearch.aspx) & [CA Name Search](http://kepler.sos.ca.gov/)
- [ ] Generate incorporation documents and sign them [[service]](#free-tool1)
- [ ] Buy registered agent service in DE - **1 yr Free**
- [ ] File incorporation docs with DE - **~$150 including fees for 1 week service**
  - You can do this yourself, but it will probably take longer and not save you much money

#### First steps with the IRS
- [ ] Apply for a Federal Employer Identification Number (EIN) - **Free**
  - [IRS info & form](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/apply-for-an-employer-identification-number-ein-online)
  - Expect the IRS to mail you a document containing your *EFTPS Pin*. This allows you to pay federal taxes electronically
- [ ] *(for founders with stock vesting)* File 83b election within 30 days of stock grant
  - reference: https://www.irs.gov/irb/2012-28_IRB/ar12.html
  - example letter: http://accountalent.com/83b-elections-for-dummies/
- [ ] *(only for S-corp)* File IRS Form 2553 to convert C-corp to S-corp
  - [IRS Form 2553](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f2553.pdf)

**NOTE:** Most of the following steps require a valid U.S. checking account and the steps above allow you to open an account. This is probably the best time to do so.

#### Register with CA
- [ ] Order certified copy of *Certificate of Good Standing* from DE - **$50**
  - Fill out [DE fillable form](https://corp.delaware.gov/certmemo.pdf) and fax to (302) 739-3812

  - Make sure **NOT** to include mailing address for registered agent
  - Include *DE Certificate of Good Standing* with mailed form
- [ ] *(optional for solo founders)* Exclude yourself from paying SDI taxes 
  - [CA form DE459](http://www.edd.ca.gov/pdf_pub_ctr/de459.pdf)
- [ ] Within 90 days of CA registration, file Statement of Information (SI-350) - **$25**
  - [CA form SI-350](https://businessfilings.sos.ca.gov/)
